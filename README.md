# Step Count and Weather Analysis

This project aims to analyze and visualize the relationship between daily step count data and weather (average temperature). The study seeks to understand the impact of weather conditions on individuals' physical activity patterns.

## Project Goals

1. To analyze data by combining daily step counts and weather data.
2. To understand the effect of weather variables on physical activity.
3. To visualize the data with graphs for clearer insights.
4. To establish a foundation for broader studies examining the connection between physical activity and weather in the future.

## Project Structure

### Data Files

- `steps_data.csv`
- `weather_datas.csv`
- `merged_datas.csv`

### Code Files

- `notebook.ipynb`

## Data Analysis and Results

### Analysis Steps

1. Data Preparation
2. Visualization

### Key Findings

1. Daily step counts are linked to temperature changes.
2. Increased physical activity is observed at moderate temperatures.
3. A decreasing trend in step counts is identified at extremely low or high temperatures.

## User Guide

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

### Running the Project

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

## Visualizations

### Daily Step Count and Average Temperature
