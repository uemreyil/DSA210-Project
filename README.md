# DSA210 Project: iPhone Health App Step Data and Weather Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, I plan to analyze my personal step count data from the iPhone Health App and investigate how weather conditions influence my daily activity levels. By integrating step data with weather information from online APIs, I aim to discover patterns in my physical activity, identify the impact of different weather conditions, and develop personalized recommendations to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.

## Dataset Description

### iPhone Health App
- **Purpose**: Provides personal activity data, including step counts.
- **Data Retrieved**:
  - Daily Step Count: The number of steps taken each day.
  - Active Minutes: Time spent in physical activity.
  - Calories Burned: Energy expenditure through daily movement.

### Weather API (e.g., OpenWeather or Weatherstack)
- **Purpose**: Supplies historical and current weather data.
- **Data Retrieved**:
  - Temperature: Daily average and range (Â°C).
  - Precipitation: Rain or snow levels (mm).
  - Weather Type: Clear, cloudy, rainy, or snowy conditions.
  - Wind Speed: Impact of wind on outdoor activity.
  - Humidity: Atmospheric moisture percentage.

## Project Idea and Plan

### Objectives
1. **Understand Activity Patterns**:
   - Analyze how my daily step counts vary across weeks and months.
   - Identify days with the highest and lowest activity levels.
2. **Impact of Weather**:
   - Examine how weather conditions affect my step counts.
   - Determine which weather types are associated with increased or decreased activity.
3. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Develop personalized suggestions for staying active, regardless of weather.

## Data Collection

1. **Step Count Data**:
   - Export step count and activity data from the iPhone Health App.
   - Organize data by date for daily analysis.

2. **Weather Data**:
   - Use a weather API to retrieve daily historical weather information for my location.
   - Match weather data to corresponding dates in the step count dataset.

## Data Analysis

### Activity Analysis
1. **Daily Step Trends**:
   - Plot step counts over time to observe trends.
   - Identify patterns, such as active vs. sedentary days.
2. **Weekly and Monthly Averages**:
   - Calculate average steps for each week and month to monitor consistency.
3. **Peak and Low Activity Days**:
   - Highlight days with the highest and lowest step counts.

### Weather Impact Analysis
1. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Explore correlations between step count and weather variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.
2. **Weather Type Comparison**:
   - Compare average steps on sunny, rainy, snowy, and cloudy days.
3. **Seasonal Variations**:
   - Examine how activity levels change with the seasons (e.g., summer vs. winter).

### Actionable Insights
- Identify weather conditions that significantly reduce physical activity.
- Suggest alternatives to maintain activity levels during adverse weather.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Insights into Activity Trends**:
   - A clear understanding of my daily, weekly, and seasonal activity patterns.
   - Identification of days and conditions that promote or hinder activity.

2. **Weather-Related Observations**:
   - Quantified impact of temperature, rain, snow, and wind on step counts.
   - Insights into how seasonal and daily weather variations shape my habits.

3. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Suggestions for staying active in unfavorable weather (e.g., indoor exercises).
   - Optimal times and conditions for outdoor activity based on past behavior.
